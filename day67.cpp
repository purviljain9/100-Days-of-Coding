// Bricks Breaking
// For her next karate demonstration, Arunima will break some bricks.
// Arunima stacked three bricks on top of each other. Initially, their widths (from top to bottom) are W1,W2,W3.
// Arunima strength is S. Whenever she hits a stack of bricks, consider the largest kâ‰¥0 such that the sum of widths 
// of the topmost k bricks does not exceed S; the topmost k bricks break and are removed from the stack. 
// Before each hit, Arunima may also decide to reverse the current stack of bricks, with no cost.
// Find the minimum number of hits Arunima needs in order to break all bricks if she performs the reversals optimally.
